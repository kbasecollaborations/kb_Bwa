            DNA-seq SampleSet or Read Library
        short-hint : |
            Select the DNA-seq SampleSet or ReadsSet object. If you have only one sample of DNA-seq reads, select the corresponding library object.

        ui-name : |
            Assembly or Genome
        short-hint : |
            Select the reference Assembly or Genome for the read alignment.

        ui-name : |
            Output Alignment Set Name Suffix
        short-hint : |
            Provide the suffix to use for the output reads alignment set name.
    output_alignment_suffix :
        ui-name : Alignment output name suffix
        short-hint : Individual alignments will be given names based on the reads object name appended with this extension.

    <p> This for maps low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. using Bwa and outputs a set of alignments in BAM format.</p>

    <p>In addition, this App outputs the alignment statistics such as total reads, total reads mapped and unmapped, number of singletons, multiple alignments, and overall successful alignment rate in the table format.</p>

    <p>Bwa supports end-to-end read alignment mode by default. This is also called an "untrimmed" or "unclipped" alignment. The App also supports "local" alignment mode, which produces alignments that might be "trimmed" (or "soft clipped") at one or both extremes in a way that optimizes the alignment score.</p>
